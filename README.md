# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This TypeScript bug demonstrates a common type error: assigning a string to a variable or parameter that expects a number.

The `bug.ts` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.

This simple example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript.  Catching these errors during development prevents runtime surprises.
